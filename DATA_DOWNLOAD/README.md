- `BAR_GRAPHS` - bar graphs produced in the `09_bar_graphs.R` script and featured in the [attendant manuscript](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dktah/).
- `SHAPES` - Identical Esri shapefile and GeoJSON file and an interactive map as an HTML file. All contain HOLC neighborhood polygons with attributes produced by the scripts herein.
- `TABLES` - output tables produced by the scripts. Please reference the README file in that folder for further information.
