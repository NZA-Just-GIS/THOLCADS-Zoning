# Organization
This directory contains three folders. They are as follows:

- `BAR_GRAPHS` - bar graphs produced in the `06_bar_graphs.R` script.
- `SHAPES` - Esri shapefile and identical GeoJSON file. Both contain HOLC neighborhood polygons with attributes produced by the scripts herein. Those attributes include % Black, % "foreign born", and average building age midpoint.
- `TABLES` - output tables produced by the scripts. Please reference the README file in that folder for further information.

# Correspondence
For any issues with these scripts, please [create an issue](https://github.com/snmarkley1/HOLC_ADS/issues).
