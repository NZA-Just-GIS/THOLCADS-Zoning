# Introduction
Here I provide provide code for [**Tabularizing HOLC Area Description Sheet Data**](https://osf.io/qytj8/). This code converts the % Black, % Foreign Born, and Building Age data provided in the area description sheets (ADS) of the Home Owners's Loan Corporation's (HOLC) city survey maps from the mid-to-late 1930s to .csv and .xlsx files. In these formats, users may now easily integrate these important historical data into their analyses.

# Abstract

# Organization
- `BAR_GRAPHS` - Three bar graphs produced from the scripts depicting average % Black, % Foreign Born, and Building Age by HOLC grade and region.
- `DATA_DOWNLOAD` - Two .csv files and three .xlsx files that HOLC researchers may download for their own use.
- `SHAPES` - Esri Shapefile and identical GeoJSON file with HOLC neighborhood polygons containing the tabular data.
- `scripts` - R scripts used to produce the downloads.
- `tables` - Input data resources. These include data that have been partially or wholly produced using manual data entry.

# Codebook
The codebook for the .csv and .xlsx output tables is provided in the `scripts` folder and in the associated writeup available at [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/qytj8/).
