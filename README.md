- `DATA_DOWNLOAD` - Four .csv files and three .xlsx files that HOLC researchers may download for their own use.
- `scripts` - R scripts used to produce the downloads.
- `tables` - Input data resources. These include data that have been partially or wholly produced using manual data entry.

# Codebook
The codebook for the .csv and .xlsx output tables is provided in the `scripts` folder and in the associated writeup available at Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/qytj8/).
